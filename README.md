Harvest, Share, Regenerate 
# Welcome to Homegrown 🍲

**Transforming surplus into soul food. Nourishing community, soil, and spirit.**  
*Ōtautahi, Aotearoa*

Homegrown is a regenerative, community-powered food initiative based in Christchurch.  
We rescue high-quality organic produce from local farms — the kind that’s too big, too bendy, too blemished, or simply too abundant to sell — and turn it into **nourishing soup, veggie stock, and roast veg bags**.

We’re not a business.  
We’re a movement rooted in:

🌱 **Food sovereignty**  
♻️ **Circular economy**  
🤝 **Mutual aid**  
💚 **Soul-aligned enterprise**

### 🍅 How It Works

- **Surplus supply** comes from our partner farm: [Streamside Organics](https://streamsideorganics.co.nz) — up to 5 tonnes of organic produce each week.
- **Processing** happens in local kitchens, starting with small-batch cooking (1–2 pots a week), frozen in our solar-powered chest freezer.
- **Delivery** is done by electric bike — to neighbours, cafes, hubs and homes.
- **Offerings** include soup, stock, and prepped veg bags — shared via a koha model and distributed locally.

This is food *for* the people, *by* the people — restoring the natural order of shared nourishment.

### ✨ Our Story

Born from a desire to **bridge ecological restoration and food justice**, Homegrown sprouted in 2024 from the soil of friendship, grief, and grit.

We saw good food going to waste.  
We saw community members going hungry or disconnected.  
We knew there was a better way.

So we started small: one pot, one pickup, one bowl at a time.

Our vision is not to scale up, but to **scale deep** — building **relational trust, decentralised participation**, and regenerative loops of exchange that honour the land and the people who care for it.

We believe in:
- Honouring the gift of food
- Embodying reciprocity
- Designing systems for belonging
